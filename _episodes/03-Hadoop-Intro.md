title: "Introduction to Hadoop"
time: 0

objectives:
- "Learn about hadoop as a platform to solve the Bidgata Analytics"
---

- An open-source implementation of frameworks for reliable, scalable, distributed computing and data storage.
- It is a flexible and highly-available architecture for large scale computation and data processing on a network of commodity hardware.

Handles thousands of nodes and petabytes of data
Hadoop subprojects:
- MapReduce: A software framework for distributed processing of large data sets on computer clusters and some others (e.g, HIVE, HBASE)â€¦
- HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System with high throughput access to application data

Goals / Requirements: 

- Abstract and facilitate the storage and processing of large and/or rapidly growing data sets
- Structured and non-structured data
- Simple programming models
- High scalability and availability
- Use commodity (cheap!) hardware with little redundancy
- Fault-tolerance
- Move computation rather than data
