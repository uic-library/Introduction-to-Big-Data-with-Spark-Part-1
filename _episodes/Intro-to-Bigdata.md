Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data–both structured and unstructured–that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis.But it’s not the amount of data that’s important. It’s what organizations do with the data that matters. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves

- To get better understanding of what big data is, it is often described using 5 Vs. (many people believe there are 4 Vs, but I think 5 Vs are more appropriate)
